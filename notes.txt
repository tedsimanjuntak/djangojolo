database migration:
1. to make migration: python manage.py makemigrations
2. to see the exact sql command generated in 1: python manage.py sqlmigrate blog 0001
3. to apply migration: python manage.py migrate

So far, we have dummy data hardcoded in blog.views, we can now add real data to the database (sqllite)
1. python manage.py shell (allow us to work with this model interactively line by line). after this, a Python-like terminal with show up.
2. from blog.models import Post
3. from django.contrib.auth.models import User
4. to print all created users: User.objects.all()
5. user = User.objects.first()
6. post1 = Post(title='Blog 1', content='First post content!', author=user)
7. post1.save()
8. to get all posts created by user: user.post_set.all()
